These angles are recorded when the 
IMU is attached to the arm with orange
connector. The DC motor is turning back 
and forth at approximately the same angles.
It moves downwards a bit as its hard to balance its
back and forth motion.
However, from run 1 to 3, the bottom is rotated,
hence the effects on the bottom rotation on the 
top angles of yaw,roll,and pitch are observed.
Roll is the only one that is barely affected and holds a 
steady value for its angles...Hence Roll is used.
